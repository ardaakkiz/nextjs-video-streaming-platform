## Project Structure

The main components of the project include:

- **Navbar**: A responsive navigation bar with links to various sections and account controls.
- **FeaturedSlider**: A component that displays featured videos with custom scrolling and drag capabilities.
- **CardHolder**: Displays categories of videos with custom horizontal scrolling.
- **FilmCard**: Individual card components for displaying video thumbnails and detailed information.
- **VideoPlayer**: A custom video player component with interactive controls such as play, pause, volume control, and progress tracking.
- **Footer**: Contains links to additional information and social media icons.

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Ensuring Additional Information Visibility for Cards**:

   - **Problem**: Horizontal overflow settings interfered with vertical content visibility, preventing seamless display of additional card information.
   - **Solution**: Implemented custom horizontal scrolling with CSS adjustments, event handlers, and momentum effects, ensuring smooth y-axis visibility.

2. **Slider Button Interference**:

   - **Problem**: Default slider controls interfered with custom button interactions, blocking click and hover events.
   - **Solution**: Removed default slider controls, added custom next/prev buttons, and implemented custom drag and scroll behavior for touch and wheel events.

3. **Flickering Control Layout Display**:

   - **Problem**: Video player controls flickered or did not display consistently.
   - **Solution**: Added event handlers for user activity and a timeout function to maintain control visibility based on user interaction.

4. **Vertical Input Range Slider Positioning**:

   - **Problem**: The use of CSS transform on sliders caused positioning issues.
   - **Solution**: Designed a custom slider component to ensure correct positioning and functionality.

5. **Dragging on Progress Bar Seamlessly**:
   - **Problem**: Confining drag interactions to the bar made navigation unintuitive.
   - **Solution**: Enhanced progress bar interactions to allow more fluid dragging behavior across the component.

## Next Steps

- Implement video detail and category pages to provide more in-depth content exploration.
- Add fullscreen customizations for a better viewing experience.
- Fix vertical slider touch dragging for enhanced mobile usability.
- Adjust controller layout and color schemes for improved accessibility.
- Introduce user accounts and profiles for personalized content.
- Implement user behavior analytics to gather insights for further improvements.
